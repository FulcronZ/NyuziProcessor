Nyuzi is an experimental multicore GPGPU processor. It supports vector floating
point, hardware multithreading, and cache coherence. The SystemVerilog-based
hardware implementation is synthesizable and runs on FPGA. This project also
includes an LLVM-based C++ toolchain, tests, and other tools. It is useful
for microarchitecture experimentation, performance modeling, and parallel
software development.

# Getting Started

The following instructions explain how to set up the Nyuzi development
environment. This includes an emulator and cycle-accurate hardware simulator,
which allow hardware and software development without an FPGA.

## Install Prerequisites

### Linux (Ubuntu)

This requires Ubuntu 14 or later to get the proper package versions. It should
work for other distributions, but you will probably need to change some package
names.

	sudo apt-get -y install autoconf cmake make gcc g++ bison flex python perl emacs openjdk-7-jdk swig zlib1g-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libedit-dev ncurses-dev libsdl2-dev gtkwave imagemagick

*Emacs is used for [verilog-mode](http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilog-mode) AUTO macros.
The makefile executes this operation in batch mode*

### MacOS

These instructions assume Mavericks or later. If you don't have XCode, install
the command line compiler like this:

    xcode-select --install

The next command installs the remaining packages, assuming you've installed
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php):

    sudo port install cmake bison swig swig-python imagemagick libsdl2 curl emacs

You may optionally install [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for analyzing
waveform files.

### Windows

I have not tested this on Windows. Many of the libraries are cross platform, so
it should be possible to port it. But the easiest route is probably to run
Linux under a virtual machine like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

## Build (Linux & MacOS)

Download and build Verilator as follows (although some Linux package managers have
it, it is way out of date). From the top level directory of this project:

    git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator tools/verilator
    cd tools/verilator
    git checkout verilator_3_880
    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    cd ../..

Download and build the Nyuzi toolchain as follows (This clones my repo. If you
want to use your own fork, change the clone URL):

    git clone https://github.com/jbush001/NyuziToolchain.git tools/NyuziToolchain
    cd tools/NyuziToolchain
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    cd ../../..

Build remaining tools and hardware model. Run unit tests.

    make
    make test

## What next?

Sample applications are available in [software/apps](software/apps). You can
run these in the emulator by typing 'make run' (some need 3rd party data
files, details are in the READMEs in those directories).

For example, this will render a 3D model:

    cd software/apps/sceneview
    make run
